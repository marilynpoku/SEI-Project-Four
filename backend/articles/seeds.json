        "tagline": "Decorated in primary color accents.",
        "text": "Following a 'Copy Paste' iteration revealed late last month, the Nike (NYSE:NKE -1.86%) Air More Uptempo returns in a 'Trading Cards' colorway said to be inspired by retro basketball trading cards. The upcoming Air More Uptempo arrives in white leather uppers with black leather “AIR” text overlays, eyestays and pull tabs. Primary colors of blue, yellow and red line the bubble text panels, and orange insoles feature a stripe graphic, possibly eluding to trading card borders. Chord laces run above the mesh tongue and Swoosh branding appears on the  toe, tongue tab, and heel. A white sole unit fitted with a translucent air bubble complete the vintage hoops sneakers. Take a look at the Nike Air More Uptempo ‘96 “Trading Cards” above, and expect the pairs to release at Nike’s website and select retailers on March 16 for $160 USD.

        "title": "adidas Originals' Forum '84 High AEC Doesn't Hold Back on the Distressed Details",
        "tagline": "Even the outsole has been aged.",
        "text": "adidas Originals is putting all its effort into the Forum ‘84 High this year, and following on from the just-announced Packer collaboration comes two general-release pairs that celebrate the pair’s age. Made under the AEC division — which is the ex-Till Jagla-helmed adidas Energy Concepts arm — we find the “Footwear White” pairs with either blue or yellow detailing and a heavily aged redesign, looking as if they’ve been lovingly beat on the basketball court. Not a single panel has escaped adidas Originals’ retro distressing touch, which adds yellow scratches and signs of wear all over the shoe, specifically working the mid panels with what looks like paint brush strokes of beige-toned damage. The distressing overlays the Three Stripes on the mid-panel, with more scuffs decorating the collar in contrast to the clean Trefoil-adorned tongue tags.However, touches such as yellowed laces and a yellowed sole unit convince you that this pair could really be OG, partly due to the fact that the detailing even reaches to the outsole which is equally aged. adidas Originals’ Forum ‘84 High AEC pack can be seen above and bought from retailers such as Sivasdescalzo on March 3 for €200 EUR a pair (approximately $224 USD. In other news, the Supreme x Nike SB Dunk Hi collaboration is almost here.",

        "text": "Balenciaga‘s red carpet-themed runway show for Spring/Summer 2022 took social media by storm, and in a futuristic turn of events the Demna-helmed label has now teamed up with the Paris-based artist Claudia Maté to create its SS22 campaign. Never one to shy away from standing out from the crowd, Balenciaga opts to put its models — namely Tommy Blue, Eugenie Bondurant, Marie-Agnès Diene, Abdou Diop, Zinedine El Ouazzani, Gwen Lu, Aki Nummela, Anania Orgeas, Hansi Schmidt, Minttu Vesala, and Inti Wang — into the realm of CGI. Maté, whose work combines video, programming, interactive 3D, game design, VR, and sound, was enlisted to reimagine the models and their looks in her signature style, and the result is something quintessentially Balenciaga. Appearing equal parts retro and futuristic, the campaign spotlights virtual reality characters wearing the XX, Hourglass, and Triplet handbags on the computer-rendered red carpet alongside ready-to-wear pieces, eyewear, jewelry, and footwear that dominated not just the runway, but also this season’s most-wanted list. Standout pieces in the campaign include the $6,050 USD Upcycled Biker Jacket, the just-released HardCrocs, the Bat Rectangle sunglasses, and a gray iteration of the Space Shoe. Take a look at the campaign above, and buy the real deal in-stores and online now.",
